Counter Module</br>
My name is Ali Azarban, a senior student in software engineering from Islamic Azad University, Urmia Branch, Iran.
Today's project, which I published on GitHub, is related to a highly functional module that is used in most service or educational websites.
The way the module works is that when the user reaches the desired area, the numbers and statistics related to each category start to increase from zero until they show the final figure.
This project is implemented with HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages.
Thank you
